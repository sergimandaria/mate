            <h1 style="font-size: 45px;">How to support new high school students</h1>
            <p class="height">Starting high school is an incredibly exciting time for students <br> and their families,
                but the transition period <br> can also
                create some anxiety.

                Teachers face the challenge of helping new students to settle into <br> this time of life and play a big
                role in their
                experience of high school. Here are some strategies <br>you can use to support students who are
                struggling with the move to
                high school.</p>
            <span class="black">Provide a safe space for students</span>
            <p class="height">Students will be faced with many changes and challenges as they <br> find their way around
                their new school, including
                experiencing information overload. It’s important, therefore,<br> that students have safe places they
                can go to, to take a
                break or seek help.

                While the classroom should always foster social inclusion, acceptance, active <br>listening and
                understanding, the school
                library and student services building are typically quieter <br> places where students can retreat to if
                they feel
                overwhelmed.

                Make sure that your students are aware of these locations early <br>in their high school experience, so
                that they can make
                effective use of them.</p>
            <span class="black">Check in with other teachers</span>
            <p class="height">If you identify a student who could be struggling with high school life, share your
                concerns about them with other
                teachers so that they can help, too. <br>

                Regularly check in with colleagues to track how students are progressing during their transition and to
                see if things
                are improving. <br> If a student appears to be having a hard time for a prolonged period, it’s important
                to refer them to the
                available support services, and to touch base <br> with their parents or carers to see what's going on.

                <br> Having an allocated time for teachers to get together and share information about their year group
                can help in
                <br> identifying students who need more support.
